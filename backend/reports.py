        For each category, analyze the data based on the prediction values (0 or 1) indicating mental health issues.
        
        Example format:
        
        BSc Computer Science (Analysis)
        
        Summary Metrics
        • Total Records for BSc Computer Science: 37
        • Predicted "Mental Health Proneness" (Predictions = 1): 7
        • Predicted "Not Prone to Mental Health" (Predictions = 0): 30
        
        Age Group Distribution:
        o 16–20 years: Majority of students (70%), with 90% classified as not prone (Prediction = 0). Only 10% classified as prone (Prediction = 1).
        o 21–25 years: 20% of students, all predominantly classified as not prone.
        o Evidence indicates that younger students face lower mental health proneness.
        
        Financial Support and Financial Problems:
        o Parent Support: 100% of students with parent support were classified as not prone (Prediction = 0).
        o Student Loans: Represents 65% of students, with 85% classified as not prone and 15% prone. Financial dependency plays a role in mental health stability.
        o Financial Problems: 80% of those facing financial problems (e.g., lower family income) were classified as prone to mental health issues (Prediction = 1).
        
        Stress Levels:
        o Stress before exams: 90% reported stress, but only 15% were prone (Prediction = 1).
        o Stress in general: 80% of students reported general stress, with a small correlation to being prone (20%).
        
        Employment Status:
        o Unemployed Students: 90% classified as not prone. Lack of work may reduce mental health risk.
        o Part-time/Full-time Jobs: 10% prone, possibly linked to time management and academic pressure.
        
        Diet and Exercise:
        o Students with healthy diets and regular exercise were predominantly not prone (95%).
        o Lack of hydration/alcohol consumption showed no strong correlation.
        
        Social Media and Device Use:
        o High social media use (15+ hours weekly): 40% prone to mental health issues.
        o Moderate use (8–15 hours weekly): 10% prone.
        o Low use (<8 hours weekly): No correlation observed with mental health proneness.
        
        Family Earning Class:
        o Lower Class: 60% prone.
        o Middle Class: 90% not prone.
        o Higher Class: 95% not prone. Economic stability correlates with mental health resilience.
        
        Gender Distribution:
        o Female students: 15% prone (Prediction = 1).
        o Male students: 5% prone.
        o Other genders (e.g., Non-binary): Higher proneness (40%), though sample size is small.
        
        Evidenced-Based Conclusion
        1. Age and Support Systems: Younger students (16–20 years) with adequate parental or financial support exhibit low mental health risks. Financial problems and lack of familial support significantly increase susceptibility.
        2. Stress and Workload: General and exam-related stress are not sole predictors of mental health issues. However, combining high stress with heavy workloads (employment) amplifies risks.
        3. Economic Class: Lower-income students face disproportionately higher mental health challenges, highlighting a critical area for intervention.
        4. Social Media Influence: Excessive use (15+ hours) correlates with increased mental health issues. Moderation appears to offer protection.
        5. Gender Differences: Females and non-binary individuals demonstrate higher vulnerability, suggesting gender-sensitive support mechanisms.
        
        Recommendations
        1. Enhance Financial Support: Universities should prioritize financial aid, especially for lower-income and international students. Emergency grants and mental health funding should be streamlined.
        2. Promote Balanced Lifestyles:
        a. Campaigns promoting healthy diets, hydration, and regular exercise should be instituted.
        b. Social media workshops to teach moderation and device-free time could mitigate digital stress.
        3. Targeted Mental Health Resources:
        a. Expand counseling and peer-support services, with a focus on gender-sensitive approaches.
        b. Provide tailored support for part-time workers balancing employment and studies.
        4. Monitor High-Risk Groups:
        a. Track stress levels and workload in younger cohorts, offering early intervention.
        b. Introduce mentorship programmes pairing upper-year students with first years for guidance.
        5. Data-Driven Initiatives:
        a. Conduct regular surveys and use predictive models to refine mental health strategies.
        b. Integrate mental health modules into the academic curriculum for greater awareness.
        
        Generally
        • Financial issues, stress, heavy social media usage, and limited physical activity are significant indicators of mental health proneness.
        • Strengthening coping mechanisms and offering financial and mental health support could mitigate risks.
        • Encouraging balanced lifestyles, reduced social media reliance, and physical activity can promote resilience.
